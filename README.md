For those interested in contributing, please clone the repo and run bundle install -> rake db:migrate -> rails s

This site is for Lords of War Games and Hobbies. It is designed to be a CMS for the store owners. The owners can sign in as an admin and add content to their news feed/products page and also add tournaments or events.

These are the dynamic pages:

* Content page

* Products page

* Tournaments page

Among those are some static pages used for geolocation of the store. This site is currently a work in progress.
